Recent technology, such as high-resolution and high-speed digital cameras, has allowed us to take a more quantitative approach by collecting data on behavior. However, the data will most likely be high dimensional, as they may represent the color of each pixel, the position of each body part, etc. Our goal is to see if we can simplify such high-dimensional representation to a much lower-dimensional description, and perhaps these \"principal\" dimensions would match the stereotypical behaviors that were found \"manually\".
